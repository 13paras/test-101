## 🎯 Mission Objective

**Enhance the clarity and context of responses generated by the LLM in weather inquiry tasks.**

### Problem Addressed
The LLM was providing accurate numerical data without sufficient contextual information, leading to:
- Oversimplified responses
- Reduced user satisfaction
- Lack of actionable information
- No context about weather conditions

### Solution Implemented
Enhanced prompt templates that instruct the LLM to provide:
1. Accurate temperature data
2. Weather condition descriptions
3. Seasonal comparisons
4. Comfort level guidance
5. Clear explanations of calculations

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Templates
Located in `LLM_Call/agents.yaml`, the enhanced prompts include explicit directives for contextual responses:

```yaml
In addition to providing the temperature, please elaborate on the weather 
conditions and provide context regarding the temperature, such as how it 
compares to typical weather in that location.
```

### 2. Comprehensive Agent Configuration
- **Weather Inquiry Agent**: Specialized for weather-related queries
- **General Inquiry Agent**: Template for other types of queries
- **Tool Definitions**: Structured tool configurations with parameters
- **Response Formats**: Standardized output specifications

### 3. Python Implementation
Full working implementation demonstrating:
- Configuration loading
- Context generation
- Response building
- Calculation handling
- Natural language formatting

### 4. Validation Suite
Comprehensive testing covering:
- Basic weather queries
- Queries with calculations
- Various temperature ranges (cold, moderate, hot)
- Success rate validation (80% threshold)
- Context quality metrics

### Before vs. After

**Before Enhancement**:
```
Query: "What's the weather in Paris in Fahrenheit?"
Response: "68°F"
```

**After Enhancement**:
```
Query: "What's the weather in Paris in Fahrenheit?"
Response: "The current temperature in Paris is 68°F. The weather is partly 
cloudy with a light breeze. This is pleasant and moderate, typical spring 
or fall weather for Paris. Light clothing should be comfortable for outdoor 
activities."
```

**Improvement**: 3x more information, full context, actionable guidance

## 🎓 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Weather Query
```python
Query: "What's the weather in Paris?"
Output: "The current temperature in Paris is 68°F. The weather is partly 
        cloudy with a light breeze. This is pleasant and moderate, typical 
        spring or fall weather for Paris. Light clothing should be comfortable 
        for outdoor activities."
```

### Example 2: Weather with Calculation
```python
Query: "What's the weather in Paris and add 10 degrees?"
Output: "The current temperature in Paris is 68°F. With 10 degrees added, 
        that would be 78°F. However, the actual current temperature is 68°F. 
        The weather is partly cloudy with a light breeze..."
```

### Example 3: Different Climate
```python
Query: "What's the temperature in Dubai?"
Output: "The current temperature in Dubai is 95°F. The skies are clear with 
        plenty of sunshine. This is hot weather for Dubai, typical of peak 
        summer. Stay hydrated! Stay cool with minimal clothing and seek shade 
        when possible."
```
