  examples:
    - input: "What's the weather in Paris in Fahrenheit?"
      output: >
        The current temperature in Paris is 68°F (20°C). The weather is partly 
        cloudy with a light breeze. This is quite pleasant and typical for Paris 
        in spring, making it comfortable for outdoor activities. You might want 
        to bring a light jacket for the evening when temperatures drop slightly.
    
    - input: "What's the weather in Paris in Fahrenheit and then add 10 to the temperature?"
      output: >
        The current temperature in Paris is 68°F. With 10 degrees added, that 
        would be 78°F. The actual conditions in Paris are partly cloudy with 
        mild temperatures - quite comfortable for this time of year. The calculated 
        temperature of 78°F would feel like a warm summer day, but remember the 
        actual temperature is the more moderate 68°F, which is typical for Paris 
        in spring.
