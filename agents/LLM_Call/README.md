# LLM Call Session Agent - Weather Inquiry Enhancement

## Overview
This agent configuration enhances the clarity and context of LLM responses for weather inquiry tasks, addressing the issue of oversimplified numerical responses lacking contextual information.

## Problem Statement
**Issue**: LLM responses for weather inquiries were providing accurate numerical data without sufficient contextual information, leading to reduced user satisfaction.

**Root Cause**: The prompt structure did not explicitly request contextual explanations or additional information, resulting in oversimplified responses.

## Solution
Enhanced prompt templates that instruct the LLM to:
1. Provide accurate temperature data
2. Include contextual weather information
3. Compare current conditions to typical weather patterns
4. Explain comfort levels and practical implications
5. Clearly articulate any calculations or conversions

## Configuration Files

### agents.yaml
Contains the LLM Call Session agent configuration with enhanced prompts for:
- **Weather Inquiry**: Comprehensive weather response guidelines
- **General Inquiry**: Contextual information handling

### tasks.yaml
Defines task structures with:
- Expected output formats
- Validation criteria
- Example inputs and outputs
- Context requirements

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Directive
The `get_current_weather` tool now includes:
```
In addition to providing the temperature, please elaborate on the weather 
conditions and provide context regarding the temperature, such as how it 
compares to typical weather in that location.
```

### 2. Response Structure Guidelines
- Current temperature in requested units
- Weather conditions description
- Seasonal comparison
- Comfort level information
- Clear explanation of calculations

### 3. Example Response Format

**Before Enhancement:**
```
User: "What's the weather in Paris in Fahrenheit?"
LLM: "68°F"
```

**After Enhancement:**
```
User: "What's the weather in Paris in Fahrenheit?"
LLM: "The current temperature in Paris is 68°F (20°C). The weather is partly 
cloudy with a light breeze. This is quite pleasant and typical for Paris in 
spring, making it comfortable for outdoor activities. You might want to bring 
a light jacket for the evening when temperatures drop slightly."
```

## Validation Criteria

✅ Response includes accurate temperature data  
✅ Response includes at least 2-3 contextual details  
✅ Language is clear and user-friendly  
✅ Calculations are explained clearly  
✅ Seasonal or comparative information is provided  

## Success Metrics

- **Target**: 80% of test cases yield context-rich outputs
- **User Satisfaction**: Improved understanding and decision-making capability
- **Response Quality**: Both accuracy and comprehensiveness

## Integration

To use this agent configuration:

1. **Load Configuration**: Import the agents.yaml file into your LLM framework
2. **Configure Tools**: Ensure weather API tools are properly connected
3. **Test Queries**: Run sample queries to validate output quality
4. **Monitor Feedback**: Track user satisfaction metrics

## Testing

### Sample Test Cases

1. **Basic Weather Query**
   - Input: "What's the weather in Paris?"
   - Expected: Temperature + conditions + context

2. **Temperature Calculation**
   - Input: "What's the weather in Paris in Fahrenheit and then add 10 to the temperature?"
   - Expected: Actual temp + calculated result + clear explanation

3. **Unit Conversion Request**
   - Input: "What's the temperature in Tokyo in Celsius?"
   - Expected: Temperature + conditions + seasonal context

## Maintenance

- Review prompt effectiveness quarterly
- Update contextual guidelines based on user feedback
- Adjust response templates as needed
- Monitor for edge cases requiring special handling

## Version History

- **v1.0** (Current): Initial enhancement with contextual prompt directives
  - Added comprehensive weather inquiry prompts
  - Implemented response structure guidelines
  - Created validation criteria and examples
