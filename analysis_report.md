# Analysis of Pydantic Query Response Generation Issues

## Current Implementation Analysis

After analyzing the codebase (`main.py`), I've identified several critical issues that could lead to incorrect or incomplete responses for the query "Explain me about Pydantic in Python":

## Identified Issues

### 1. **Extremely Vague System Prompts**
- **Coding Question Prompt**: `"Your task is to solve the coding question of the user."`
- **Simple Question Prompt**: `"Your task is to solve the simple question of the user."`

**Problem**: These prompts provide no context, structure, or guidance about how to respond to technical questions about Python libraries like Pydantic.

### 2. **Problematic Query Classification Logic**
- The `DetectCallResponse` model uses the confusing field name `is_question_ai` (should be `is_coding_question`)
- The classification prompt lacks specificity about what constitutes a "coding-related question"
- A question about Pydantic could be misclassified as either coding or non-coding

### 3. **Forced Error Simulation**
- The code artificially introduces errors after 2 successful calls (`MAX_SUCCESSFUL_CALLS = 2`)
- This simulation could interfere with natural response generation

### 4. **No Domain-Specific Context**
- No guidance about Python library explanations
- No structured format for technical documentation responses
- Missing examples, use cases, or code snippets guidance

### 5. **Inadequate Error Handling**
- Missing `raise` statement on line 94: `Exception(f"Error in solve_coding_question: {str(e)}")`
- This would cause silent failures rather than proper error propagation

## Expected vs Current Behavior

### Expected Good Response Should Include:
1. **Overview**: What Pydantic is and its purpose
2. **Key Features**: Data validation, type hints, parsing, serialization
3. **Code Examples**: Basic usage with BaseModel
4. **Use Cases**: Integration with FastAPI, API validation, configuration management
5. **Benefits**: Runtime type checking, automatic data conversion, error handling

### Current Behavior Issues:
- Generic responses due to vague prompts
- Potential misclassification between coding/simple question paths
- No structured approach to technical explanations
- Risk of crashes due to artificial error injection

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue is **insufficient prompt engineering**. The system prompts are too generic and don't provide the AI model with:
- Context about the type of response expected
- Structure for technical explanations
- Guidance on including code examples
- Instructions for comprehensive coverage of Python libraries
