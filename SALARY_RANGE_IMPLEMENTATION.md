# Salary Range Implementation - Job Posting System

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of mandatory salary range requirements in the job posting system to ensure compliance with legal transparency requirements.

## Problem Statement
The job posting for the Production Assistant role at Warner Bros. Discovery was missing a salary range, which:
- Violates salary transparency laws in many jurisdictions
- Reduces candidate attraction and trust
- Creates compliance risks

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Task Configuration Updates (`src/job_posting/config/tasks.yaml`)

#### Added: Salary Research Task
A new task specifically dedicated to researching industry-standard salary ranges:
- Analyzes compensation data from reliable sources
- Considers geographic location, experience level, and industry standards
- Provides a competitive, compliant salary range

#### Updated: Draft Job Posting Task
- Added MANDATORY requirement to include salary range section
- Specified format requirements ($45,000 - $60,000 per year)
- Linked to salary research findings

#### Updated: Review and Edit Task
- Added CRITICAL VALIDATION for salary range presence
- Requires rejection if salary range is missing or unclear
- Validates format and compliance requirements

### 2. Crew Configuration (`src/job_posting/crew.py`)

Added `salary_research_task()` method:
```python
@task
def salary_research_task(self) -> Task:
    return Task(
        config=self.tasks_config['salary_research_task'],
        agent=self.research_agent()
    )
```

This task runs as part of the sequential workflow, ensuring salary data is available before drafting the job posting.

### 3. Template Structure (`templates/job_posting_template.yaml`)

Created a comprehensive job posting template with:
- **Mandatory salary_range field** with validation rules
- Structured format for minimum, maximum, currency, and period
- Built-in validation rules for compliance

Key validation rules:
- Salary range must be provided
- Minimum must be less than maximum
- Range should be based on market research
- Display format must include specific dollar amounts

### 4. Validation Workflow (`workflows/job_posting_approval.py`)

Created `JobPostingValidator` class with methods:

- **`validate_job_posting()`**: Main validation entry point
- **`_validate_salary_range()`**: Checks for salary range presence
- **`_validate_salary_range_format()`**: Validates format and reasonableness
- **`_validate_required_sections()`**: Ensures all required sections exist
- **`get_validation_report()`**: Generates human-readable validation report

**Key Features:**
- Raises `ValueError` if salary range is missing (critical compliance)
- Supports both structured data and markdown text
- Pattern matching for various salary range formats
- Warnings for unreasonable ranges

### 5. Job Description Example Update

Updated `src/job_posting/job_description_example.md` to include:

```markdown
### Compensation
**Salary Range:** $120,000 - $160,000 per year

The actual salary offered will depend on experience, qualifications, and 
internal equity considerations. This range reflects our commitment to 
competitive compensation based on current market standards.
```

### 6. Validation Integration (`src/job_posting/validation_callback.py`)

Created callback functions to integrate validation with CrewAI workflow:
- `validate_final_job_posting()`: Validates output after review task
- `check_salary_range_in_output()`: Quick check for salary range presence

## Testing

### Test Suite (`workflows/test_validation.py`)

Comprehensive test coverage includes:

1. **Test 1**: Valid job posting with salary range ✓
2. **Test 2**: Missing salary range (correctly rejected) ✓
3. **Test 3**: Structured data with salary range ✓
4. **Test 4**: Invalid salary range with warnings ✓

**Test Results:** All 4/4 tests passed

### Running Tests

```bash
cd workflows
python3 test_validation.py
```

## Compliance Requirements Met

✅ **Legal Compliance**
- Salary range is now mandatory in all job postings
- Validation enforces inclusion before approval
- Complies with salary transparency laws

✅ **Transparency**
- Clear, specific dollar amounts required
- Based on market research and industry standards
- Displayed in consistent, readable format

✅ **Quality Assurance**
- Multi-layer validation (task level + workflow level)
- Format validation ensures readability
- Reasonableness checks prevent errors

## Workflow Integration

The updated workflow now follows this sequence:

1. **Research Company Culture** → Research Agent
2. **Research Role Requirements** → Research Agent
3. **Research Salary Range** → Research Agent (NEW)
4. **Draft Job Posting** → Writer Agent (with salary requirement)
5. **Review and Edit** → Review Agent (with salary validation)
6. **Validation Check** → JobPostingValidator (enforces compliance)

## Usage Example

### For Production Assistant Role

The system will now:

1. Research market salary data for Production Assistants in Los Angeles
2. Draft job posting including researched salary range
3. Review to ensure salary range is:
   - Present and clearly labeled
   - Formatted correctly ($X - $Y per year)
   - Based on market data
4. Validate before final approval

**Expected Output:**
```markdown
## Compensation
**Salary Range:** $45,000 - $60,000 per year

This range is based on industry standards for Production Assistant roles 
in the Los Angeles area, considering the experience level and 
responsibilities outlined above.
```

- `src/job_posting/config/tasks.yaml` - Added salary research task, updated draft and review tasks
- `src/job_posting/crew.py` - Added salary_research_task method
- `src/job_posting/job_description_example.md` - Added compensation section

### Created:
- `templates/job_posting_template.yaml` - Comprehensive template with validation rules
- `workflows/job_posting_approval.py` - Validation logic and JobPostingValidator class
- `workflows/__init__.py` - Package initialization
- `workflows/test_validation.py` - Comprehensive test suite

## Validation API

### Basic Usage

```python
from workflows import validate_job_posting_with_report

job_posting = "..." # Your job posting text or dict

is_valid, report = validate_job_posting_with_report(job_posting)

if not is_valid:
    print("Validation failed:")
    print(report)
else:
    print("Validation passed!")
```

### With Exception Handling

```python
from workflows import validate_job_posting

try:
    validate_job_posting(job_posting)
    print("Job posting is valid!")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Critical error: {e}")
```

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
1. Integration with real-time salary data APIs (e.g., Glassdoor, PayScale)
2. Geographic-based salary adjustment factors
3. Historical salary trend analysis
4. Multi-currency support for international roles
5. Benefits value calculation in total compensation

## Conclusion

The salary range implementation ensures:
- **Legal Compliance**: Mandatory salary ranges meet transparency requirements
- **Enhanced Transparency**: Candidates see clear compensation expectations
- **Quality Control**: Multi-layer validation prevents oversight
- **Market Alignment**: Research-based ranges reflect industry standards

All validation tests pass, and the system is ready for production use.
